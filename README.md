# colorTemp-Past-Codes
Some past codes for reference

Included a matlab file that I just tested tonight (20200409).
colorTemp.mlx might only work completely on Matlab on Windows system for some reason. I tried with Mac and Windows and Mac is acting weirdly with ginput. So to make it work, please use Windows. Haven't tested for Linux but hopefully it works.

To run it:
Open colorTemp.mlx
Run it.
When the first request that asks you to open an image, open colorscale.png in the directory.
Continue running.
The second time when it asks you to open an image, open scotland.png in the directory.
Continue running.
When a picture window pops up, click on anywhere in the ocean around scotland a few times until the picture disappears.
The file will be able to generate an ocean temperature gradiant in the sea around scotland.
